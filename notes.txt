A progress bar is a graphical representation of the completion status of a task or operation, typically displayed as a horizontal bar that fills up as the task progresses.
Your task is to create a reusable progress bar component in React. The component should visually represent the percentage of progress towards the maximum value. Please refer to the provided GIF as a reference; your progress bar should look and behave similarly.
Instructions:
Create a functional component named Progress.
The Progress component should accept two props
value: A number representing the current progress.
maxvalue: A number representing the maximum progress(optional, defaults to 100)
Use the following color codes for the appearance of the progress bar:
Progress background-color: #EEEEEE
Indicator background-color: #635BFF

Next, enhance the accessibility of the progress bar by incorporating relevant ARIA attributes, such as role, aria-valuemin, aria-valuemax, aria-valuenow and aria-valuetext.
